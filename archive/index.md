Please see the following list for papers we have read in recent weeks, in reverse chronological order.
Please note:

* Links will be to open-access PDFs/pre-prints *where possible*, but unfortunately these are not always available. I have tried to include multiple links to both open-access and paywall (e.g. ACM, Springer Link, IEEE) for each in case of dead links, and for ease of citation.
* The initial date is the date of the reading group, not the publication of the paper.
* New papers will be added when I remember. [Email me](mailto:martin.dehnel-wild@cs.ox.ac.uk?subject=Martin you've forgotten to update the Reading Group Website) if I forget. :-)
* Where the publication venue says 'Discussion', this was a discussion-group meeting (included for completeness), rather than a reading group.
