The Security Reading Group is a small group that meets weekly during Oxford full term, and often outside of term too. The group is run by [Martin Dehnel-Wild](mailto:martin.dehnel-wild@cs.ox.ac.uk), overseen by Prof. [Andrew Martin](andrew.martin@cs.ox.ac.uk), and its mailing list website can be found [here](https://mailman.cs.ox.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/se-read). The fastest way to subscribe to the mailing list is to send Martin an email.

Visitors from other universities or external companies with a genuine interest in technical aspects of security are welcome to attend, but please do email in advance for access.
