This is the website for The University of Oxford Security Reading Group. Here you will find contact information for how to join the mailing list, meeting information, and a list of the papers we have read and discussed historically.

### Further Information
We typically meet on Fridays at 3pm, in Robert Hooke Building (RHB) room 114. Access is from the Computer Science entrance just off Parks Road, next to the Museum of Natural History. To be added to the mailing list, please email martin.dehnel-wild(at)cs.ox.ac.uk.
