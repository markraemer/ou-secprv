This is the website for the University of Oxford Security Reading Group. Here you will find contact information for how to join the mailing list, meeting information, and a list of the papers we have read and discussed historically.

### Further Information
We typically meet on Fridays at 3pm, in Robert Hooke Building (RHB), Room 114. Access is from the Computer Science entrance just off Parks Road, next to the Museum of Natural History. To be added to the mailing list, please email [Martin Dehnel-Wild](mailto:martin.dehnel-wild@cs.ox.ac.uk). Upcoming meetings are normally listed after the weekly email has gone out on the [Cyber Security Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fg56lmvbg5cd7dne58gssm9ido%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London).

## Archive of Papers
Please see the following list for papers we have read in recent weeks, in reverse chronological order. Links will be to open-access PDFs where possible, but these are not always available. The initial date is the date of the reading group, not the publication of the paper. New papers will be added when I remember. Where the publication venue says 'Discussion', this was a discussion-group meeting (included for completeness), rather than a reading group.
