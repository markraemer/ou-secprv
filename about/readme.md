Readme for jekyll / github pages:

How to update the ReadingGroup website:

* Open index.md and add this week's paper to the top of the file.

* Open the directory in the command line and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` if you want to check it locally. To see it, visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/ReadingGroup/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/ReadingGroup/)

* If it all works happily, do `git add . && git commit -m 'my lovely commit message' && git push -u origin gh-pages`
