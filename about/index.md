The Security Reading Group is a small group that meets weekly during Oxford full term, and often outside of term too. The group is run by [Martin Dehnel-Wild](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/martin.dehnel-wild/), overseen by Prof. [Andrew Martin](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.martin/), and its mailing list website can be found [here](https://mailman.cs.ox.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/se-read). The fastest way to subscribe to the mailing list is to send Martin an [email](mailto:martin.dehnel-wild@cs.ox.ac.uk).

Visitors from other universities or external companies with a genuine interest in technical aspects of security are welcome to attend, but please do email in advance for access.
